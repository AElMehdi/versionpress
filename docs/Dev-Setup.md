# Dev setup

ðŸš§ This is being updated for Dockerized dev setup ðŸš§

## Getting started

Install:

- Git 2.10+
- Node.js 8+
- Docker 17+

Then run:

1. `git clone <repo>` && `cd <repo>`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

You can now log in to a WordPress site at `http://localhost:8088`, username `admin`, password `adminpwd` (all this can be changed via `docker-compose.yml`).

This leaves you with this working environment:

- VersionPress source files are mapped to container's `wp-content/plugins/versionpress` so any changes you make locally are immediately reflected in the test site.
    - The React `./frontend` app requires a build, see below.
- Database can be inspected at `http://localhost:8099`, server name: `db`, username: `root`, password: `r00tpwd`.
    - You can also use tools like MySQL Workbench or `mysql` command-line client on port 3399, e.g., `mysql --port=3399 -u root -p`.
- WordPress site is mapped to `./dev-env/wp` where you can inspect the files and Git history using your favorite tools.
- To invoke things like WP-CLI in the context of a test WordPress site, you have these options:
    - SSH into container the container: `docker-compose exec wordpress /bin/bash`
    - Use `docker-compose exec wordpress <command>`, for example:
        - `docker-compose exec wordpress wp option update blogname "Hello"`
        - `docker-compose exec wordpress git log`
- Stop all Docker services: `Ctrl+C` in the console. `npm run cleanup-docker-stack` clears up everything if you want to start fresh. Otherwise, both files and database data are persisted.

## PhpStorm setup

We recommend [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for VersionPress development.

The initial `npm install` copies `.idea` to `./plugins/versionpress` where most things are already configured, however, some manual steps are still needed.

On the first PhpStorm start, you'll see two prompts:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26286846/c369a5b0-3e6e-11e7-8781-c1a3c8446aa6.png)

**Enable WordPress support** but leave the installation path empty (ignore the warning):

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26286883/6d11d22c-3e6f-11e7-94eb-a4c0287fb181.png)

Also initialize the **Composer** support:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26286903/c2d1befc-3e6f-11e7-9296-062fbed20983.png)

For **Code Sniffer** inspections to work, there's a one-time configuration: Go to *Settings* > *Languages & Frameworks* > *PHP* > *Code Sniffer*, select *Local*, click the three dots next to it and provide your full system path to `./vendor/bin/phpcs`. After this is done, PhpStorm will start checking the code style.

> Note: the same checks run on Travis CI once the code is pushed to GitHub so it's useful to have that configured in PhpStorm.

It is also useful to **install the [EditorConfig](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294?pr=phpStorm) extension**, VersionPress ships with some basic formatting rules in `.editorconfig`.

## Writing code

Please refer to the [Contributing code](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code) section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Debugging

> **Note**: VersionPress consists of core PHP code plus React app for the frontend. This section is about PHP debugging only.

The development environment is preconfigured with [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/). Here's an example setup:

1. Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file next to `docker-compose.yml` (it's in the repo root, not in `./plugins/versionpress`). You can copy it from `docker-compose.override.example.yml`.
2. Put your computer IP address there as seen on the local network, e.g., `192.168.1.2`. Tools like `ipconfig` or `ifconfig` will show that.
3. Start the Docker stack: `docker-compose up`.
4. In PhpStorm, go to Settings > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Servers and create a server with two file mappings:<br><br>![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26285020/999202ea-3e47-11e7-8859-c792ca0d7d36.png)<br><br>
    - `<project root>/plugins/versionpress` -> `/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/versionpress`
    - `<project root>/ext-libs/wordpress` -> `/var/www/html`
5. The default zero configuration settings in Settings > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Debug should be fine: <br><br>![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26285067/34fefbd4-3e48-11e7-8f11-544507a1c5f7.png)<br><br>
6. Enable debugging in the browser, most commonly using a [browser extension or a bookmarklet](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/Browser+Debugging+Extensions): <br><br> ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26764669/7f3e4dc0-496b-11e7-9dc2-10351d6378bc.png)
7. Place a breakpoint somewhere and start listening for debug connections ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26285076/5b9b2ca4-3e48-11e7-8ea3-280f9027831a.png)

Debugging should now work:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26285090/bb8aa432-3e48-11e7-973a-944abfe0039e.png)

## Testing

Tests are currently about 60% of the PHP code in the project so pretty significant. They live in the `./plugins/versionpress/tests` directory and there are several types of them, from unit tests to full end2end tests.

> Note that the `./frontend` app might have its own tests. This section is about core VersionPress tests.

### Dockerized setup

Running tests is much easier with Docker, however, there is some initial setup. VersionPress ships with PhpStorm project files so some of the things below might be already set up for you but let's do a full walk-through.

 First, if you're on Mac or Windows, expose this daemon in Docker settings:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27441580-43a964c8-576e-11e7-9912-1be811f73c4b.png)

In PhpStorm, create a new Docker environment:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27441828-ec760098-576e-11e7-9251-670204bf2643.png)

In the Docker panel, you should now be able to connect:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27441986-508eb2e6-576f-11e7-83b6-20e9b6944619.png)

Now let's define a remote interpreter. Make sure you have the **PHP Docker** plugin enabled and go to *Settings* > *Languages & Frameworks* > *PHP*. Add a new interpreter there:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27442419-6e177932-5770-11e7-9d28-dfc219a41fcd.png)

We recommend some image with Xdebug installed, e.g., `phpstorm/php-71-cli-xdebug`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27456995-518482f0-57a3-11e7-9d77-cd254c56a7c5.png)

These two paths should be mapped into the container:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27457048-78b63800-57a3-11e7-83c2-fd97b8caf6bc.png)

The final step is to set up a test framework:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27457076-9afdc02c-57a3-11e7-8b00-7d3dc8dae5a3.png)

Now you're ready to run the tests.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are best suited for small pieces of algorithmic functionality. For example, `IniSerializer` is covered with unit tests extensively.

You can run any or all unit tests in PhpStorm easily e.g. by right-clicking test names. The Run panel should look like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27459292-c8eadbe6-57ad-11e7-96bd-3b77f255247f.png)

Debugging also works well:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27459354-23388d96-57ae-11e7-8bc0-684d6634e6d6.png)



## Production build

Run `npm run build`,  it will produce a file like `dist/versionpress-3.0.2.zip`.

The version number is based on the nearest Git tag and can also be something like `3.0.2-27-g0e1ce7f` meaning that the closest tag is `3.0.2`, there have been 27 commits since then and the package was built from `0e1ce7f`. See [`git describe --tags`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe#_examples) for more examples.
