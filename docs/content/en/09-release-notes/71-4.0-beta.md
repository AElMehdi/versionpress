## New in 4.0-beta

- For plugin definitions, `WP_CONTENT_DIR/.versionpress/plugins/<plugin-slug>` is now the preferred location. For example, VersionPress will first try to load definitions from `wp-content/.versionpress/woocommerce` (user-editable location) and then fall back to `wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/.versionpress` (bundled with plugin).
